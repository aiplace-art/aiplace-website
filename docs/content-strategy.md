"Designing a token? Start with these 5 questions:

1. What problem does this token solve?
(If your answer is 'it's a governance token,' try again)

(Harsh truth: Most projects don't need a new token)

3. What drives demand?
(Utility, scarcity, or speculation?)

4. What prevents inflation?
(Burn mechanisms, staking, vesting?)

5. What happens when early holders exit?
(This kills most projects)
