- ⚠️ No active state for current page navigation
- ⚠️ Scroll transition at 20px is abrupt

**Quick Wins:**
```tsx

+ className="bg-gradient-brand hover:shadow-glow-brand"

// 2. Add active navigation state

// 3. Smooth scroll transition
- background: scrolled ? "bg-white/95" : "bg-white"
+ background: `rgba(255, 255, 255, ${Math.min(scrollY / 20, 0.95)})`
```

**Target Score:** 8.5/10
